/*
do we need a with a with-pen macro or a  with-dc macro?
following the motifzone document
we define a device-context structure (or should it be a class)
we use functions which call the corresponding win32 function to
manipulate the the device context.
The gdi uses handles which is a 32 bit unsigned int.
Since the most-positive-fixnum in clisp is 24 bits, the
foreign-pointer is used (pointer to void).  All handles are
this type.
Since out parameters are passed as multiple values,
adopt the convention that the return value is first,

change of plan we use cparse to generate structure assignment
code in c.  then call directly from c.
